## garden.yml reference

Below is the full schema for the `garden.yml` configuration files. For an introduction,
please look at our [configuration guide](../using-garden/configuration-files.md).

Note that individual module types, e.g. `container`, add additional configuration keys. The built-in module types
are listed in the [Built-in module types](#built-in-module-types) section. Please refer to those for more details
on module configuration.

  repo:

  # The Deployment, DaemonSet or StatefulSet that Garden should regard as the _Garden service_ in

  # contain any number of Kubernetes resources, this needs to be specified for certain Garden
  # features and commands to work, such as hot-reloading.
  # We currently map a Helm chart to a single Garden service, because all the resources in a Helm
